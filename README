this program merges data files, each data files contains number of (x,y) pairs. this program
sums up all y value from different files. if a x value is in file 1 but not in file 2, 
this program calculates the y value for file 2 using interpolation algorithm
usage : merge_curves [-o output_file] dataset1 dataset2  ... datasetn
if there is no output file is defined, the output will be printed to the console


i.e.
dataset1
1.2 5.0
2.3 3.5
3.8 3.0

dataset2
0.8 2.0
1.5 3.0
2.5 4.0

output:
output:
0.8 0.0 2.0      # contribution from 1st array is 0, it is out of x range, from 2nd is 2.0
1.2 5.0 7.57     #5.0 + 2.0 + (1.2-0.8) * (3.0-2.0)/(1.5-0.8) contribution from 1st array is 5.0, from 2nd is 2.57
1.5 4.6 7.6      #3.0 + 5.0 + (1.5 - 1.2) * (3.5 - 5.0) / (2.3 - 1.2)  contribution from 1st array is 4.6, 2nd is 3.0
2.3  ...
2.5  ...
3.8  3.0 0.0     #contribution from 2nd array is 0, it is out of x range.


usage:
merge_curves -o output_file input_file1 input_file2 .... input_filen
